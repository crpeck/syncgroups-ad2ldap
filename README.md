Sync groups from Active Directory LDAP.
=======
==================

Sync Active Directory Groups into LDAP Groups. 
Simple python script that will sync groups from Active Directory to an ou in LDAP.

This will copy all the entries from an ou in AD to an ou in LDAP, See the 'ini' file
for examples. 
The code is pretty self-explanatory.
